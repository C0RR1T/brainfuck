The program is written in Rust. How does Langfuck determine a keyword?

Langfuck goes through every character and check if the character matches to a first character of every keyword and checks if they match. If they do, Langfuck gets the next n characters the length of the matching keyword. If the keyword matches, the keyword gets added to the lexed tokens.
