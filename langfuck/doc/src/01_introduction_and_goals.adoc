== Introduction and Goals
This language is a Transpiler for brainfuck. The program can transpile every
dialect of brainfuck, i.E. cow. We use json files stored in the /langs subdirectory, which provide mappings to the original brainfuck characters (just typed out). These languages will be included in the binary at compile time. This means that the end-user cannot provide his own language (he could by contributing to https://github.com/C0RR1T/brainfuck[the Repository]). This prevents validating the json, because we know that the files in the langs directory is valid (through manually checking the pull requests). +

Basically, through this method we could compile every language ever, given that it is turing complete. +

Also, this transpiler also ships with an interpreter, which means langfuck is JITT (Just in time transpiled). The interpreter is out of this scope since it is another project.

Langfuck acts more as a lexxer, which passes the brainfuck tokens to the parser and then the interpreter.



=== Requirements Overview

* [ ] Finished Documentation
* [x] Short presentation about langfuck
* [ ] Working transpiler
* [ ] Transpiler can output brainfuck code into a file
* [x] Transpiler has program arguments which are parsed into options
* [x] Transpiler can call interpreter

=== Quality Goals

* The Transpiler is well tested
* The transpiler can transpile every instruction of every language file
* The program arguments are easy to understand
